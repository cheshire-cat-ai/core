## What is this?

The Cheshire Cat is a framework to build custom AIs on top of any language model.
If you ever used systems like WordPress or Django to build web apps, imagine the Cat as a similar tool, but specific for AI.

Why use the Cat:
- 🌍 Language model agnostic (works with OpenAI, Cohere, HuggingFace models, custom)
- 🐘 Long term memory
- 🚀 Extendible via plugins
- 🔧 Can use external tools (APIs, custom python code, other models)
- 📄 Can ingest documents (.pdf, .txt, .md)
- 🐋 100% [dockerized](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- 👩‍👧‍👦 Active [Discord community](https://discord.gg/bHX5sNFCYU)

If you want to know more about our vision and values, read the [Code of Ethics](./readme/CODE-OF-ETHICS.md). We are committed to openness, privacy and creativity, we want to bring AI to the long tail.

This project is growing fast, refactorings and code changes happens very often, join the [Issues](https://github.com/cheshire-cat-ai/core/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc) to help!

- [YouTube tutorial - How to install](https://youtu.be/Rvx19TZBCrw)

## Quickstart

### Try in on GitHub Codespace
You can try Cheshire Cat on GitHub Codespace. The free account provides 60 free hours a month.

[![Try in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/cheshire-cat-ai/core)


#### Instructions

- Right-click this [link](https://codespaces.new/cheshire-cat-ai/core) and select "open a new window." It will open a webpage titled "Create a new codespace":
- You can ignore the options on the screen and press the green button "create codespace"
- Wait for the codespace to load, and then type on the terminal "docker-compose up"
- It will take a few minutes. When you read "Application startup complete," it will show three links: REST API, PUBLIC, and ADMIN.
- Click on the ADMIN link to configure Cheshire Cat and start playing with it.
- Have fun!
- As soon as you're satisfied, you can press "CTRL C" on the terminal to stop the Cheshire Cat. Then type docker-compose down to close the docker container.

### Install

To make Cheshire Cat run on your machine, you just need [`docker`](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [`docker-compose`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed.
Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cheshire-cat-ai/core.git cheshire-cat
```

Enter the created folder:

```bash
cd cheshire-cat
```

After that you can run:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

> NOTE: if you have a later version of docker-compose, use the command `docker compose up` (without the dash). [REF.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66514436/difference-between-docker-compose-and-docker-compose) 

The first time (only) it will take several minutes, as the images occupy a few GBs.

- Chat with the Cheshire Cat on [localhost:1865/admin](http://localhost:1865/admin).
- You can also interact via REST API and try out the endpoints on [localhost:1865/docs](http://localhost:1865/docs)

As a first thing, the Cat will ask you to configure your favourite language model.
It can be done directly via the interface in the Settings page (top right in the admin).

Enjoy the Cat!

When you're done, remember to CTRL+c in the terminal and
```
docker-compose down
```

### Update

From time to time it is a good idea to update the Cat:

```
docker-compose down
git pull origin main
docker-compose build --no-cache
docker-compose up
```

### Running Tests

To run the tests within the Docker container, execute the following command:

```bash
docker exec cheshire_cat_core python -m pytest --color=yes .
```

If you are running the tests locally on your machine, use the following command:

```bash
python -m pytest --color=yes .
```

```
"Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?"
"That depends a good deal on where you want to get to," said the Cat.
"I don't much care where--" said Alice.
"Then it doesn't matter which way you go," said the Cat.
