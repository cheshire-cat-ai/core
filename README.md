## Production ready AI assistant framework

The Cheshire Cat is a framework to build custom AIs on top of any language model. 
If you have ever used systems like WordPress or Django to build web apps, imagine the Cat as a similar tool, but specific for AI.

## Quickstart

To make Cheshire Cat run on your machine, you just need [`docker`](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -p 1865:80 ghcr.io/cheshire-cat-ai/core:latest
```
- Chat with the Cheshire Cat on [localhost:1865/admin](http://localhost:1865/admin).
- You can also interact via REST API and try out the endpoints on [localhost:1865/docs](http://localhost:1865/docs)

As a first thing, the Cat will ask you to configure your favourite language model.
It can be done directly via the interface in the Settings page (top right in the admin).

Enjoy the Cat!  
Follow instructions on how to run it with [docker compose and volumes](https://cheshire-cat-ai.github.io/docs/quickstart/installation-configuration/).

## Minimal plugin example

```python
from cat.mad_hatter.decorators import tool, hook

# hooks are an event system to get finegraned control over your assistant
@hook
def agent_prompt_prefix(prefix, cat):
    prefix = """You are Marvin the socks seller, a poetic vendor of socks.
You are an expert in socks, and you reply with exactly one rhyme.
"""
    return prefix

# langchain inspired tools (function calling)
@tool(return_direct=True)
def socks_prices(color, cat):
    """How much do socks cost? Input is the sock color."""
    prices = {
        "black": 5,
        "white": 10,
        "pink": 50,
    }

    price = prices.get(color, 0)
    return f"{price} bucks, meeeow!" 
```

## Conversational form example

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from cat.experimental.form import form, CatForm

# data structure to fill up
class PizzaOrder(BaseModel):
    pizza_type: str
    phone: int

# forms let you control goal oriented conversations
@form
class PizzaForm(CatForm):
    description = "Pizza Order"
    model_class = PizzaOrder
    start_examples = [
        "order a pizza!",
        "I want pizza"
    ]
    stop_examples = [
        "stop pizza order",
        "not hungry anymore",
    ]
    ask_confirm = True

    def submit(self, form_data):
        
        # do the actual order here!

        # return to convo
        return {
            "output": f"Pizza order on its way: {form_data}"
        }
```

- 🚀 Extensible via plugins (public plugin registry + private plugins allowed)
- 🎚 Event callbacks, function calling (tools), conversational forms
- 🏛 Easy to use admin panel (chat, visualize memory and plugins, adjust settings)
- 🌍 Supports any language model (works with OpenAI, Google, Ollama, HuggingFace, custom services)
- 🐋 Production ready - 100% [dockerized](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- 👩‍👧‍👦 Active [Discord community](https://discord.gg/bHX5sNFCYU) and easy to understand [docs](https://cheshire-cat-ai.github.io/docs/)

```
"Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?"
"That depends a good deal on where you want to get to," said the Cat.
"I don't much care where--" said Alice.
"Then it doesn't matter which way you go," said the Cat.
