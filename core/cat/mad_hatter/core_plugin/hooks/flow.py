    Bootstrapping is the process of loading the plugins, the natural language objects (e.g. the LLM), the memories,
    the *Main Agent*, the *Rabbit Hole* and the *White Rabbit*.

    This hook allows to intercept such process and is executed in the middle of plugins and
    natural language objects loading.

    This hook can be used to set or store variables to be propagated to subsequent loaded objects.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cat : CheshireCat
        Cheshire Cat instance.

    This hook allows to intercept the end of such process and is executed right after the Cat has finished loading
    its components.

    Parameters
    ----------

    Allows to edit and enrich the incoming message received from the WebSocket connection.

    For instance, this hook can be used to translate the user's message before feeding it to the Cat.
    Another use case is to add custom keys to the JSON dictionary.

    The incoming message is a JSON dictionary with keys:
        {
            "text": message content
        }

    Parameters
    ----------
    user_message_json : dict
        JSON dictionary with the message received from the chat.
    cat : CheshireCat
        Cheshire Cat instance.


    Returns
    -------
    user_message_json : dict
        Edited JSON dictionary that will be fed to the Cat.

    Notes
    -----
    For example:

        {
            "text": "Hello Cheshire Cat!",
            "custom_key": True
        }

    where "custom_key" is a newly added key to the dictionary to store any data.

    This hook allows to edit the user's message used as a query for context retrieval from memories.
    As a result, the retrieved context can be conditioned editing the user's message.

    Parameters
    ----------
    user_message : str
        String with the text received from the user.
    cat : CheshireCat
        Cheshire Cat instance to exploit the Cat's methods.

    Returns
    -------
    Edited string to be used for context retrieval in memory. The returned string is further stored in the
    Working Memory at `cat.working_memory.recall_query`.

    Notes
    -----
    For example, this hook is a suitable to perform Hypothetical Document Embedding (HyDE).
    HyDE [1]_ strategy exploits the user's message to generate a hypothetical answer. This is then used to recall
    the relevant context from the memory.
    An official plugin is available to test this technique.
