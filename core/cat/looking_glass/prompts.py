You can use one of these actions:
{tools}
- "final_answer": Use this action to finish or if no relevant action is available. Input is always null.

## The JSON must have the following structure:

```json

## Action output

After each action there will be an action output in this format:
```json
{{
    "action_output": // output of the preceding action
}}
```

## Final answer / no action available
When you have a final answer (or no tools are relevant), use the following format:
```json
{{
    "action": "final_answer",
    "action_input": null
}}
